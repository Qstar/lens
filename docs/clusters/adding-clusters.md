# Adding clusters

Add clusters by clicking the Add Cluster button in the left-side menu. You'll need to obtain a working kubeconfig for the cluster you want to add. You can either browse it from the file system or paste it as a text from the clipboard.

Selected cluster contexts are added as a separate item in the left-side cluster menu to allow you to operate easily on multiple clusters and/or contexts.

**NOTE**: Any manually added cluster is not merged into your kubeconfig file.
