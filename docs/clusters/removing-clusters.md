# Removing clusters

You can remove a Lens Clusters from your cluster list using the context-menu of the cluster item in the left-side menu. By right-clicking the cluster of choice you can hit the `Remove` button to delete it from your list. 

**NOTE**: This will only remove the cluster from your Lens Cluster list but not affect your actual Kubernetes Cluster or its configuration!
