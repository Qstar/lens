## Color Themes

Color themes let you modify the colors in Lens user interface to suit your preferences and work environment.

In Lens, open the Preferences with **File** > **Preferences**. (**Code** > **Preferences** on macOS) and select your preferred theme from the **Color Theme** dropdown.

## Telemetry & Usage Tracking

Lens collects telemetry data, which is used to help understand how to improve the product. For example, this usage data helps to debug issues, such as slow start-up times, and to prioritize new features. While we appreciate the insights this data provides, we also know that not everyone wants to send usage data and you can disable telemetry as described in [disable telemetry reporting](#disable-telemetry-reporting). You can also read our [privacy statement](https://www.mirantis.com/company/privacy-policy/) to learn more.


### Disable telemetry reporting

If you don't wish to send usage data to Mirantis, you can disable the "Telemetry & Usage Tracking" in the Lens preferences.

From `File > Preferences` (macOS: `Lens > Preferences`), search for `Telemetry & Usage Tracking`, and uncheck the `Allow telemetry & usage tracking`. This will silence all telemetry events from Lens going forward. Telemetry information may have been collected and sent up until the point when you disable the setting.
